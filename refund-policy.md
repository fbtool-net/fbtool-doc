# Refund Policy

Thank you for choosing fbtool.net.

At fbtool.net, we are committed to providing high-quality tools and services to support your work. To ensure clarity and transparency in all transactions, we would like to inform you about our **Refund Policy**.

***

#### No Refunds Under Any Circumstances

**Please note:** All purchases and service usages on fbtool.net are **final and non-refundable**. We **do not offer refunds, exchanges, or credits** under any circumstances, including but not limited to:

* **Dissatisfaction with the service:** We encourage users to thoroughly research and try out (if available) our services before making a purchase.
* **Change of needs:** A change in your purpose of use or no longer needing the service after purchase will not qualify for a refund.
* **User error:** Any errors arising from the user's side during the use of the service (e.g., incorrect operations, providing inaccurate information) will not be refunded.
* **Discontinuation of service use:** Your decision to stop using the service before the purchased term expires will not result in a refund for the remaining period.
* **Other objective reasons:** Except for severe system errors from fbtool.net that cannot be rectified, we do not issue refunds for any other objective reasons.

We understand that a "no refund" policy is a significant decision, and we want to ensure you fully understand this before making any transactions.
